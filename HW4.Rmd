This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

1. Create the Vectors:

a) (1,2,3,...,19,20)
```{r}
1:20 #Putting ":" between 1 and 20 will create a vector counting from 1 to 20
```

b) (20,19,...,2,1)	
```{r}
20:1 #Likewise, 20:1 creates a vector counting down from 20 to 1
```

c) (1,2,3,...,19,20,19,18,...,2,1)	
```{r}
c(1:20,20:1) #the c method combines our vectors 1:20 and 20:1
```

d) (4,6,3) and	assign	it	to	the	name	tmp.		
```{r}
tmp <- c(4,6,3) # tmp <- assigns the vector on the right to the name tmp
```

e) (4,6,3, 4,6,3,...,4,6,3)	where	there	are	10	occurrences	of	4.	
```{r}
e <- c(4,6,3) #Assigns the vector on the right to the name e
rep(e, 10) #Uses the rep function to repeat the vector e 10 times
```

f) (4,6,3,4,6,3,...,4,6,3,4)	where	there	are	11	occurrences	of	4,	10	
occurrences	of	6	and	10	occurrences	of	3.	
```{r}
rep(e, len = 31) #Replicates the vector e until 31 numbers have been printed. This results in 11 instances of 4, and 10 instances of 6 and 3. 
```

g) (4,4,...,4,6,6,...,6,3,3,...,3)	where	there	are	10	occurrences	of	4,	20	occurrences	of	6	and	30	occurrences	of	3.
```{r}
rep(e, c(10,20,30)) #Replicates the vector e with the first number therein printed 10 times, the second 20 times, and the third 30 times. 
```

2) Create	a	vector	of	the	values	of	(e^x)cos(x)	at	x	=	3,3.1,3.2,...,5.9,6.
```{r}
increment = seq(3,6,.1) #Creates a vector called increment that goes from 3 to 6 in increments of .1. 
(exp(increment)*cos(increment)) #exp(x) is the equivalent of e^x. This line performs e^x * cos(x) on every x in increment, and returns all of the results in a vector. 
```

3. Create	the	following	vectors:
a) (0.1^3, 0.2^1, 0.1^6, 0.2^4, 0.1^9, 0.2^7,...,0.1^36, 0.2^34)
```{r}
first = seq(3,36,3) #Creates a vector that goes from 3 to 36 counting by 3
second = seq(1,34,3) #Creates a vector that goes from 1 to 34 counting by 3
exponents = c(rbind(first,second)) #The rbind function creates a vector that alternates the elements of the inputted vectors. Here, we have alternated the lists first and second, which gives us a list corresponding to the exponents we want to utilize.  
base = rep(c(0.1,0.2), len = 24) #Creates a vector of alternating 0.1s and 0.2s 24 elements long. 
base ^ exponents #Creates a vector where each element i is the ith element of base put to the power of the ith element of exponents. 
```
b) (2, (2^2)/2, (2^3)/3 ,..., (2^25)/25)
```{r}
fraction <- (1:25) #This gives us a vector that counts upwards from 1 to 25
twos <- rep(2, len = 25) #Gives us a vector of 25 2s
(twos^fraction)/fraction #Puts each element of vector twos to the power of the corresponding element in fraction. Then divides the elements of the resulting list by the corresponding elements of fraction. This outputs the vector that we want. 
```

4. Calculate the following:
a. The sum of i^3 + 4i^2 from i = 10 to i = 100
```{r} 
e = 10:100 #Creates a vector e counting upwards from 1 to 100
sum(e^3 + 4*(e^2)) #The sum operation adds up all of the elements of a vector. Here, the vector we have input into sum is that where each element in e has been put into the equation described above. 
```

b. The sum of (2^i)/i + (3^i)/i^2 from i = 1 to i = 25
```{r}
f = 1:25 #Creates a list f counting upwards from 1 to 25 
sum((2^f)/f + (3^f)/(f^2)) #Performs the operation required on each element of f, and then returns the summation of the outputted vector. 
```

5. Use the function paste to create the following vectors of length 30. 
a) ("label	1",	"label	2",	.....,	"label	30"). Note	that	there	is	a single	space	between	label	and	the	number following. 
```{r}
paste(rep("label", len=30), 1:30) #The paste function puts converts its inputs into strings and puts them together. Here the items inputted into paste are rep("label", len=30), which is a vector of the word "label" printed 30 times, and 1:30, or a vector that counts up from 1 to 30. This outputs the vector "label 1", "label 2"...."label 30".
```

b. ("fn1",	"fn2",	...,	"fn30").	In	this	case,	there	is	no	space	between	fn and	the	number	following.
```{r}
paste0(rep("fn", len=30), 1:30) #This function is similar to the one used for 5a), but instead of using the paste operation, here paste0 is used. Paste0 does not place an empty space between the two vectors that it puts together. 
```

6) Execute the following lines which create two vectors of random integers which are chosen with replacement from the integers 0, 1, ..., 999. Both vectors have length 250. 

```{r}
set.seed(50) 
xVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=T) #Randomly samples 250 numbers from the numbers 0 to 999 with replacement, and assigns the result to the name xVec. 
yVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=T) #Does the same and assigns the result to the name yVec. 
```

Suppose x = (x1,x2,...,xn) denotes the vector xVec and y = (y1,y2,...,yn)
denotes the vector yVec.

a. Create the vector (y2 - x1, ... yn - x(n-1))
```{r}
yVec[2:250] - xVec[1:249] #yVec[2:250] refers to a vector containing the last 249 elements of yVec, while xVec[1:249] refers to the first 249 vectors in xVec. Subtracting these subtracts the corresponding components of the two vectors and outputs a vector of the result. 
```

b. Create the vector (sin(y1)/cos(x2), sin(y2)/cos(x3),...,sin(yn-1)/cos(xn))
```{r}
sin(yVec[1:249])/cos(xVec[2:250]) #yVec[1:249] is the first 249 elements of yVec. xVec[2:250] refers to the last 249 elements of xVec. Here, we are dividing the sine of each element of yVec[1:249] by the cosine of the corresponding elements of xVec[2:250]. 
```

c. Create the vector (x1 + 2x2 -x3,...,xn-2 + 2xn-1 - xn )
```{r}
#We need 83 1s, 83 2s, and 84 -1s. 
xVec*rep(c(1,2,-1), len = 250) #Here we are multiplying our xVec's elements by the corresponding vector we are creating with the rep function. This vector consists of the vector 1, 2, -1 repeated until it reaches the length 250 (i.e. the length of our xVec.)
```

d. Calculate the sum of e^(-x(i+1)) / (xi + 10) from i = 1 to i = n-1. 
```{r}
sum(exp(-xVec[2:250])/(xVec[1:249]+10)) #Within the sum function, we have an equation, which divides e to the -xVec[i+1] by xVec[i] + 10. This runs from i = 1 to i = 249, and outputs a vector as a result. Placing this equation within the sum operation adds together all elements of that vector and returns the total. 
```

7) This	question	uses	the	vectors	xVec	and	yVec	created	in	the	previous
question	and	the	functions	sort, order,	mean,	sqrt,	sum	and	abs.

a. Pick out values of yVec which are > 600
```{r}
subset(yVec, yVec > 600) #The subset function allows you to input a vector and a condition, and then returns all values in that vector that meet your condition. 
```

b. What are the index positions in yVec of the values which are > 600?
```{r}
which(yVec > 600) #The which operator comes up with all elements of a vector that meet the specified condition. 
```

c. What	are	the	values	in	xVec	which	correspond	to	the	values	in	yVec
which	are	>	600?	(By	correspond,	we	mean	at	the	same	index	
positions.)
```{r}
xVec[which(yVec>600)] #which(yVec>600) returns a list of indices. By putting these in brackets in front of xVec, we return all values of xVec corresponding with those index positions. 
```

d. Create the vector |x1 - meanx|^.5 ... |xn - meanx|^.5, 
```{r}
abs(xVec-mean(xVec))^.5 #The mean function finds the mean value in the inputted vector. Here we are subtracting each individual component of xVec by the mean of xVec, and raising the absolute value of the result to the 1/2 power. This returns a vector of results.  
```

e. How many values in yVec are within 200 of the maximum value of the terms in yVec. 
```{r}
length(which(abs(max(yVec)-yVec)<200)) #(abs(max(yVec)-yVec)<200) returns a list of TRUE and FALSE, where the positions on yVec where this position holds are replaced by TRUE, and those where it does not replaced by FALSE. Putting this function inside of the operator which returns a list of index positions where TRUE is the value, ignoring indices occupied by FALSE. Finally, putting this inside of the length function in effect returns the number of TRUE values returned, i.e. the number of values in yVec which are within 200 of the maximum value in the vector. 
```

f. How many numbers in xVec are divisible by 2?
```{r}
length(which(xVec %% 2 == 0)) #This works similarly to the last function written. Which(xVec %% 2 == 0) returns a list of indices where xVec is divisible by 2. We then take the length of this list, which corresponds to the amount of even numbers within xVec. 
```

g. Sort	the	numbers	in	the	vector	xVec	in	the	order	of	increasing	values	in	yVec
```{r}
xVec[order(yVec)] #order(yVec) orders yVec's elements from lowest to highest and then returns their corresponding indices as a vector. Putting this in brackets in front of xVec returns the elements of xVec that correspond with the index positions in order(yVec). 
```

h. Pick	out	the	elements	in	yVec	at	index	positions	1,4,7,10,13,â€¦
```{r}
xVec[seq(1, 250, 3)] #Seq(1, 250, 3) creates a vector going from 1 to 250 in increments of 3. Putting this in brackets after xVec returns the values of xVec corresponding to corresponding to the index positions seq(1, 250, 30).
```

8. By using the function cumprod or otherwise, calculate:
1+ 2/3 + (2*4)/(3*5) + (2*4*6)/(3*5*7) + ... + (2*4*...38)/(3*5*...39)
```{r}
evens = seq(2,38,2) #Creates a vector of numbers going from 2 to 38 in steps of 2. 
odds = seq(3,39,2) #Creates a vector of numbers going from 3 to 39 in steps of 2. 
cumevens = cumprod(evens) #Creates a vector where each element is the product of all equivalent and preceeding positions of our evens vector. 
cumodds = cumprod(odds) #Creates a vector where each element is the product of all equivalent and preceeding position of the odds vector. 
sum(c(1, cumevens/cumodds)) #c(1, cumevens/cumodds) creates a vector that starts with 1. Each element after 1 is the product of an element of cumevens divided by the corresponding element of cumodds. This vector corresponds with the numbers that we need to add up in order to solve our problem, so we just put it inside of the sum operator to get our result. 
```
